# VMDetector

VMDetector is a C program designed to identify whether it is running inside a virtual machine (VM) environment. This tool utilizes various techniques to detect common virtualization platforms, making it useful for security analysis, anti-malware applications, and system integrity checks.

## Features

- Detects common virtualization platforms such as VMware, VirtualBox, Hyper-V, and more.
- Lightweight and efficient.
- Provides a simple API for integration into other projects.

## Requirements

- A C compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang, MSVC)
- Windows operating system (for current version)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/VMDetector.git
    cd VMDetector
    ```

2. Compile the source code:
    ```sh
    gcc -o vm_detector vm_detector.c
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the compiled program:
    ```sh
    ./vm_detector
    ```

2. The program will output whether it is running inside a VM and provide details about the detected environment.

## Example Output
````
VM Detected: Yes
Virtualization Platform: VMware
````
